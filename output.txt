Enter the number of vertices: Enter the number of edges: Enter the edges in their respective direction starting with the first edge as 0. For ex :- 
0 1
3 2
5 1
Vertex 0: in-degree = 0, out-degree = 0
Vertex 1: in-degree = 1, out-degree = 3
Vertex 2: in-degree = 1, out-degree = 2
Vertex 3: in-degree = 2, out-degree = 1
Vertex 4: in-degree = 2, out-degree = 0
